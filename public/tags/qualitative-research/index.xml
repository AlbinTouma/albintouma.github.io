        &lt;p&gt;Adverse Media, also known as negative news screening, requires that companies identify risks associated with a company or individual in media. Traditionally, compliance officers use Google and keyword searches to find articles, but this process has largely been automated by machine learning models that can identify risks in thousands of articles online.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The explosion in the number of articles that companies process has led to confusion in the compliance industry as to what we mean by “good coverage” when we talk about adverse media. Many fall back on quantity as a measure of good coverage, but this approach is flawed due to the high levels of noise in adverse media. Some sources are simply irrelevant - for example, one provider boasts about scraping 200,000 domains, including recipe blogs. Part of the challenge is the lack of a standard way to describe sources.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this article I’ll share with you how I designed an adverse media typology and why the relevance of sources is more important than their perceived reliability.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Typology of sources in adverse media&lt;span class=&#34;absolute -mt-20&#34; id=&#34;typology-of-sources-in-adverse-media&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#typology-of-sources-in-adverse-media&#34; class=&#34;subheading-anchor&#34; aria-label=&#34;Permalink for this section&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;I set out to build a typology to help communicate our coverage and sources to clients. As such, our adverse media typology had to explain why we selected specific sources and not “everything” in order to move the conversation away from “quantity” to relevance and quality.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The table below, created through iterations with clients and regulatory affairs, serves as an example of how to define sources in adverse media.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;table&gt;
&lt;thead&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;th&gt;Typology&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;Description&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/thead&gt;
&lt;tbody&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;International newspaper&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;News aggregators, online websites, internationally distributed newspapers&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;National newspaper&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;A newspaper distributed in one country on a national level&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Regional newspaper&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;A newspaper distributed in a city or region&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Judicial authority&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;A source extracted from a court or judicial ministry&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Police authority&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;A source extracted from a police department or agency&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Public authority&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;A source extracted from a public authority or international organisation&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Industry or professional blog&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;A blog or company website published by a professional or company&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The legal research behind the typology&lt;span class=&#34;absolute -mt-20&#34; id=&#34;the-legal-research-behind-the-typology&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#the-legal-research-behind-the-typology&#34; class=&#34;subheading-anchor&#34; aria-label=&#34;Permalink for this section&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The taxonomy is based on best practices rather than regulatory requirements. From legal research and collaboration with our regulatory affairs team, we found that adverse media regulatory requirements are broad and similar across countries. Regulations do not clearly define what sources AML officers should cover, and clients often struggle to articulate their needs. This broad regulatory landscape allows us the freedom to shape and improve our typology.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the absence of strict regulatory requirements, I turned to industry best practices to define what “good” means in adverse media. One organisation providing such guidance is the Wolfsberg Group.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Best Practices&lt;span class=&#34;absolute -mt-20&#34; id=&#34;best-practices&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#best-practices&#34; class=&#34;subheading-anchor&#34; aria-label=&#34;Permalink for this section&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Wolfsberg Group recommends prioritising international, national and regional newspapers and to keep in mind countries with restricted press freedoms. They suggest compliance officers rely on these sources due to their higher quality reporting and editorial oversight, which ensure corroborated and edited content. Regional and local newspapers are also useful for reporting on events not covered by larger outlets but can be less reliable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Why the Typology is Not a Ranking of Sources&lt;span class=&#34;absolute -mt-20&#34; id=&#34;why-the-typology-is-not-a-ranking-of-sources&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#why-the-typology-is-not-a-ranking-of-sources&#34; class=&#34;subheading-anchor&#34; aria-label=&#34;Permalink for this section&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Initially, I considered ranking sources based on reliability, placing public, judicial, and government sources at the top. However, client feedback revealed that prioritising certain sources could lead to an overemphasis on quantity over quality. Clients often asked, “Why can’t we have more judicial sources?” The reality is that there are only so many courts in a country. Instead of ranking sources, we built the taxonomy around the concept of relevance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Aim for Relevance Rather than Strict Reliability&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Wolfsberg Group’s recommendations are concerned with high-ranking sources on Google and emphasise international and national newspapers as “reliable sources”. However, with a machine learning approach, the goal is to cover what is most relevant while also retrieving pages that simple keywords might miss.  Think of adverse media as a search-optimised (SEO) iceberg. A well-defined typology helps us demonstrate the relevance of our sources, covering both the visible top-ranking domains and the curated sources below the surface that an AML officer might miss with simple keyword searches.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Impact&lt;span class=&#34;absolute -mt-20&#34; id=&#34;impact&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#impact&#34; class=&#34;subheading-anchor&#34; aria-label=&#34;Permalink for this section&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The typology helps the adverse media team demonstrate the relevance of our sources. There are only so many newspapers published on a national and regional level, and by labelling our sources, it is possible to explain to clients why those specific newspapers were selected and others were excluded. This shifts the conversation from “Do you cover everything” (as if adverse media screening is a tick box exercise)  to “No, we curate a list of relevant sources and won’t to cover everything and anything”. With the typology, we can also show clients how we capture the SOE iceberg by listing the largest and most known media sources and then demonstrating how we also include less well-known media sites.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Recap&lt;span class=&#34;absolute -mt-20&#34; id=&#34;recap&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#recap&#34; class=&#34;subheading-anchor&#34; aria-label=&#34;Permalink for this section&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Adverse Media is full of noise, and the industry has yet to agree on what constitutes “good media coverage”. The focus often remains on quantity rather than relevance. With a typology of sources in Adverse Media, we can pivot the conversation and discuss “relevance”. This way, the industry can ask whether an AML provider curates relevant sources.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Mapping Media - A Qualitative Approach to Estimating Globals News Coverage&#34;</title>
      <link>http://localhost:1313/posts/mappingmedia/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>

      <description>
        
        
        &lt;p&gt;Recently I was asked to join the adverse media team as their new researcher. While the team had a robust database of news sources, they had no way of knowing what news sources exist in different countries. Not knowing &amp;ldquo;what&amp;rsquo;s out there&amp;rdquo; made it difficult to identify gaps in our data, so I set out to build a knoweldge base of the world&amp;rsquo;s news sources.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Identifying sources&lt;span class=&#34;absolute -mt-20&#34; id=&#34;identifying-sources&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#identifying-sources&#34; class=&#34;subheading-anchor&#34; aria-label=&#34;Permalink for this section&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Identifying the world’s news sources is not straightforward. Comprehensive lists of newspapers worldwide do not exist. To estimate available news sources in a country, I developed a research process for collating a comprehensive list of news sources in different countries.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;DBPedia &amp;amp; Wikipedia Lists&lt;span class=&#34;absolute -mt-20&#34; id=&#34;dbpedia--wikipedia-lists&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#dbpedia--wikipedia-lists&#34; class=&#34;subheading-anchor&#34; aria-label=&#34;Permalink for this section&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Wikipedia is a rich source of information for identifying newspapers in a country. You can use search terms like “list of newspapers in [country]” to find these lists. Wikipedia has two strengths. It usually labels newspapers as national and regional, aiding in labelling easier. Most newspapers also have their own dedicated Wikipedia page with detailed information, such as circulation, owners, and publication status.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can use the DBPedia scraper to extract information about newspapers in a country. Add the name of the country to the query and the script will iterate through all of the hyperlinks on the page and extract information from the information boxes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One thing to keep in mind is that the DBPedia scraper extracts information from all of the hyperlinks on a page, including irrelevant pages like towns or regions. You can filter for &amp;ldquo;newspaper&amp;rdquo; type only if you want to avoid cleaning the data. However, filtering reduces the number of hits substantially since DBPedia data is not properly organised. My recommendation is to not filter as the ratio of irrelevant data to newspapers is low.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Official Directories&lt;span class=&#34;absolute -mt-20&#34; id=&#34;official-directories&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#official-directories&#34; class=&#34;subheading-anchor&#34; aria-label=&#34;Permalink for this section&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Official directories list registered national and regional newspapers and can be found via Google searcher or on a country’s press ombudsman’s website. While these directories often only provide the name and domain of media sources, their official status make them valuable sources of truth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Open-source projects and Unofficial Directories&lt;span class=&#34;absolute -mt-20&#34; id=&#34;open-source-projects-and-unofficial-directories&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#open-source-projects-and-unofficial-directories&#34; class=&#34;subheading-anchor&#34; aria-label=&#34;Permalink for this section&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Several unofficial directories and open-source projects, like WorldMap, contain names and domains of thousands of newspapers worldwide. Additionally, blog posts for language learners and media directories hosted by companies offer useful lists. These sources can supplement official directories, though they may require verification.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Collating multiple sources of truth into a knowledge base&lt;span class=&#34;absolute -mt-20&#34; id=&#34;collating-multiple-sources-of-truth-into-a-knowledge-base&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#collating-multiple-sources-of-truth-into-a-knowledge-base&#34; class=&#34;subheading-anchor&#34; aria-label=&#34;Permalink for this section&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;To estimate media sources in any country, we create a country research sheet on Google Drive and store data from each directory in separate tabs:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Wikipedia&lt;/b&gt; : Use DBPedia scraper to extract information from the country’s list of newspapers page. Clean the data to remove irrelevant information, such as ceased publications.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;WorldMap&lt;/strong&gt;: Run the world newspaper map scraper to collect data from this open-source project.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Official Directories&lt;/strong&gt;: Add data manually or with a script from press directories.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Company Data&lt;/strong&gt;: Include our existing database in its own tab. Filter by country code and extract our domains for that country.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Other sources: Add any additional identified sources.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Labelling and Collating Sources&lt;span class=&#34;absolute -mt-20&#34; id=&#34;labelling-and-collating-sources&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#labelling-and-collating-sources&#34; class=&#34;subheading-anchor&#34; aria-label=&#34;Permalink for this section&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The next step is to manually label sources based on our typology, determining their classification. This process is facilitated by first collating sources and then filtering out those without a taxonomy. Collation involves merging research tabs into a master list that serves as our knowledge base of media sources in a country.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The Result&lt;span class=&#34;absolute -mt-20&#34; id=&#34;the-result&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#the-result&#34; class=&#34;subheading-anchor&#34; aria-label=&#34;Permalink for this section&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The result is a comprehensive list of the adverse media team’s newspapers and the sources we believe exist in each country. With this collated list, our sales team can identify the number and types of media sources we cover. Internally, we can spot data gaps and review new sources for inclusion. Sources rejected in the review are flagged with reasons for their exclusion, maintaining a clear and up-to-date database.&lt;/p&gt;
